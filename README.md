# Overview

This project is capable of solving a Sudoku puzzle using a genetic algorithm. Puzzle configurations are read in from a plain text file containing a string of 9 x 9 digits separated by spaces, with an example provided in the file `puzzle_mild.txt`. Zero is used to represent an unknown digit, whereas numbers in [1, 9] are assumed to be known/given.

Run the code by executing `python sudoku.py` at the command line.
